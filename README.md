# Border Manager 

### Compatible with: 
    Minecraft 1.19.1
### Tested on: 
    A 1.19.1 paper server

## Usage

Move a jar file of this project into the `plugins` directory and copy in the `BorderManager` directory.
Inside the `BorderManager` directory exist a file titled `borders.brd`. 
Despite the funny extension the file can be edited with a plain text editor like notepad.
<strong>OBSERVE</strong> that the file  follows a strict syntax, and lacks input sanitation.
Each line in the file represents one set of coordinates written in the format: <br>
x<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>2</sub><br>
Where x<sub>1</sub> < x<sub>2</sub> and z<sub>1</sub> < z<sub>2</sub>.
Without any spaces, negative numbers can be represented by a negative sign(`-`)
